<h1> Project Overview </h1>

This project is a CI/CD pipeline designed to automate the build, test, and deployment of a Java application using Maven, SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, and Kubernetes. The pipeline ensures code quality, security, and efficient deployment while leveraging modern DevOps tools and practices. Additionally, Prometheus and Grafana are integrated for monitoring and visualizing application performance and infrastructure metrics.

<h1> Solution Overview </h1>

**Code Management (GitHub):**

The pipeline starts by checking out the source code from a GitHub repository.

Ensures the latest code is used for building and testing.

**Build and Test (Maven):**

Compiles the Java application using Maven.

Runs unit tests to ensure code functionality.

**Code Quality Analysis (SonarQube):**

Performs static code analysis using SonarQube to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

Ensures the code meets quality standards before proceeding.

**Artifact Management (Nexus):**

Publishes build artifacts (e.g., JAR files) to Nexus for version control and dependency management.

**Containerization (Docker):**

Builds a Docker image of the application for consistent deployment across environments.

Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy.

**Deployment (Kubernetes):**

Deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster using a deployment manifest (deployment-service.yaml).

Verifies the deployment by checking the status of pods and services.

**Monitoring and Visualization (Prometheus & Grafana):**

Prometheus collects metrics from the Kubernetes cluster and application.

Grafana visualizes the metrics in real-time dashboards for performance monitoring and troubleshooting.

<h1> Key Technologies </h1>

**GitHub:** Version control and source code management.

**Maven:** Build automation and dependency management.

**SonarQube:** Static code analysis for quality assurance.

**Nexus:** Artifact repository for storing build outputs.

**Docker:** Containerization for consistent deployment.

**Trivy:** Security scanning for Docker images and file systems.

**Kubernetes:** Orchestration for scalable and reliable deployment.

**Prometheus:** Monitoring and alerting for infrastructure and application metrics.

**Grafana:** Visualization of metrics collected by Prometheus.

<h1> Workflow </h1>

**Code Checkout:** Pull the latest code from GitHub.

**Build and Test:** Compile and test the application using Maven.

**Code Quality Check** Analyze code quality with SonarQube.

**Artifact Publishing:** Upload build artifacts to Nexus.

**Docker Image Build:** Create a Docker image and scan it for vulnerabilities using Trivy.

**Kubernetes Deployment:** Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster and verify the deployment.

**Monitoring Setup:** Configure Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana to visualize them.

<h1> Impact </h1>

**Automation:** Reduces manual effort and ensures consistent builds and deployments.

**Code Quality:** Improves code quality through static analysis and testing.

**Security:** Identifies vulnerabilities in both code and Docker images using Trivy.

**Scalability:** Enables scalable and reliable deployment using Kubernetes.

**Monitoring Setup:** Configure Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana to visualize them.

<h1> Key Achievements </h1>
